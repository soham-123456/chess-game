# chess-game

******Project Overview:******
This is a full-stack online chess game. The backend is built with Node.js, TypeScript, and WebSockets, handling real-time multiplayer chess logic. The frontend is a React + TypeScript app (using Vite) that provides a modern, interactive chessboard UI for users to play chess online.

**Features : **
    Real-time Online Chess: Play chess against another player in real time. 
    WebSocket Communication: Fast, bidirectional updates between players. 
    Automatic Matchmaking: Players are paired automatically when they join.
    Modern UI: Responsive, visually appealing chessboard and interface.
    Move Validation: All moves are validated using the chess.js library.
    Game Over Detection: The backend detects and announces game over conditions.

**Tech Stack**
  Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, WebSocket (ws), chess.js for chess logic
